# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is focused on predicting the likelihood of diabetes using a machine learning approach on the PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset. The aim is to build a basic yet functional model that can be expanded or deployed in future applications.

## Dataset
- The dataset used is `diabetes.csv`, which includes medical data such as:
  - Pregnancies
  - Glucose
  - Blood Pressure
  - Skin Thickness
  - Insulin
  - BMI
  - Diabetes Pedigree Function
  - Age
  - Outcome (0 or 1)

## Project Structure
The project has been broken down into multiple scripts for better understanding:
- `MLproject_step1.py`: Initial data loading and inspection
- `MLproject_step2.py`: Handling missing or zero values
- `MLproject_step3.py`: Feature scaling
- `MLproject_step4.py`: Splitting data into training and testing sets
- `MLproject_step5.py`: Model training and evaluation

## Goal
To build a simple logistic regression model that can classify whether a person has diabetes or not, based on the given features.

## How to Run
1. Make sure all the `.py` files and `diabetes.csv` are in the same folder.
2. Run each script step-by-step to follow the project pipeline.

## Future Ideas
- Try out different classification algorithms like Random Forest or XGBoost
- Build a frontend using Streamlit or Flask
- Add accuracy comparison across models
