Project Overview: Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict whether a person has diabetes based on clinical features such as glucose level, BMI, age, blood pressure, insulin levels, etc. Using a dataset of patient records, I built a machine learning model using Logistic Regression that learns patterns from the data and makes predictions with measurable accuracy.
The entire pipeline includes:
-Data loading and preprocessing (handling missing values)
-Feature scaling using StandardScaler
-Train-test split for fair evaluation
-Model training using Logistic Regression
-Evaluation using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report
-Testing the model on new patient data to validate performance

The model is currently in a basic version and performs well on the given dataset.

Technologies Used:
-Programming Language: Python 3.9
-Data Handling & Manipulation:
-pandas – for loading and processing tabular data
-numpy – for numerical operations
-Data Preprocessing:
-StandardScaler from sklearn.preprocessing – to scale features to the same range
-Model Building:
-LogisticRegression from sklearn.linear_model – used for binary classification
-Model Evaluation:
-accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, classification_report from sklearn.metrics – to assess model performance
-Data Splitting:
-train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection – to split dataset into training and testing sets
-Development Environment:
-Visual Studio Code (VS Code) – for writing and running the Python scripts


There are several improvements and advanced features I plan to implement to take this project to a higher level:
-Use of other classifiers like Random Forest, SVM, and Gradient Boosting
-Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation
-Data visualization and interactive user input (e.g., via GUI or web app)
-Better handling of missing data using imputation techniques
-Support for larger and more diverse datasets

Future Work:
This project is not limited to diabetes. I plan to extend it by training similar models for other diseases such as heart disease, hypertension, and mental health-related conditions, using appropriate clinical and genomic datasets.
